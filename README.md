# ScarabHunter
By Leland Joshua Barnard 

This project was completed as of December 2019. A demo level of a 2D platform game I made for my senior project, called "Scarab Hunter" where the goal is to run and jump your way through a level collecting golden scarabs of different values.  This was a solo project. I created this game using Unity, C#, and Visual Studio 2017.  I wrote the scripting in C# myself (a few functions were pre-built assets in Unity).  I had 3 months to complete this project; I planned the project, collected and organized the assets, animated the characters and icons, scripted all character, score, and gameplay functionality.  I rendered everything in the Unity Engine. This game demo level is available to purchase and play at: https://leejay-games.itch.io/scarab-hunter
