# ScarabHunter
By Leland Joshua Barnard 

This project is complete as of December 2019. I am working on uploading it to Github.  It is fairly large. A demo level of a 2D platform game I made for my senior project, called "Scarab Hunter" where the goal is to run and jump your way through a level collecting golden scarabs of different values.  I created this game using Unity, C#, and Visual Studio 2017.  I wrote most of the scripting in C# mtself (a few functions were pre-built assets in Unity).  I had 3 months to complete this project, I planned the project, collected and organized the assets, animated the characters and icons, scripted all character, score, and gameplay functionality.  I rendered everything in the Unity engine.
